### About The Project

Every student preparing for campus placements has faced the chaos: scattered notes, dozens of browser tabs for different resources, and the constant anxiety of not having a structured study plan. It's easy to feel overwhelmed and lose track of your progress.

**PrepStack** was built to solve this exact problem.

It's a full-stack MERN application that serves as a single source of truth for your entire preparation journey. Instead of jumping between different platforms, PrepStack provides a centralized and modern dashboard to manage everything, transforming a disorganized process into a clear, actionable plan. The goal is to empower students with the tools they need to stay consistent, organized, and confident.
